# Red-Black-tree
A red-black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree In this tree each node has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color (red or black). These colors are used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. Although the balance of the tree is not perfect, it is good enough to reduce the searching time and maintain it around O(log n) time The code contains following functions :

1. Traverse
2. Insert
3. Delete Number 0 is used to indicate black color and 1 to red.
